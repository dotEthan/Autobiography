It started as an idea for a portfolio page that mimicked the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) idea of using one HTML and many themes, much the way a person, like myself, is built of many events throughout their life. Now we've gone a bit silly, but you get the idea. One HTML, three CSS.

### Status

Functionally complete and working. It no longer builds or runs locally as the dependencies haven't been updated in 5 years, one day I may fix that. 

## Overview and Thoughts

### What Worked

I built what I set out to build.

### What Didn't Work

Honestly, a lot. My early code is terrible, the whole javascript file needs to be refactored into a proper "Functional" system. 

I didn't do nearly enough design, which led to very long production times and a lot of rewrites of HTML as I went.

## What Lessons Were Learned

Setting up everything before you start. Design it fully, create the spec for how your code will be set up (functional vs OO), CSS naming scheme, etc.
